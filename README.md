## Hey I'm RyudSwift 👋

### [Project Home](https://github.com/ryudswift/your-repo) | [Live Demo](https://ryudswift.github.io/your-repo/)

### About Me:
I'm an automation specialist and business strategist passionate about bridging the gap between technology and real-world outcomes. My focus is on building efficient systems and workflows that solve actual problems, not just for the sake of automation itself.

## 🎯 What I'm Focused On

    🤖 Workflow Automation & Orchestration: Deep expertise in designing and implementing automation solutions, especially with tools like n8n.

    📈 SaaS Development & Business Strategy: Advising on lean GTM approaches and helping businesses identify and solve real customer challenges.

    🤝 Community & Education: I believe in learning in public and sharing knowledge. I'm currently building resources to help others get started in automation.

## 🌱 I'm Currently Learning

I'm always expanding my toolkit. Right now, my main focus is diving deeper into Python to build more robust and scalable automation engines.
💡 My Philosophy

I approach problems with a mindset-first perspective. It's not just about the code; it's about asking the right questions.

    "Automation isn’t just about workflows, it’s about solving real business problems."

    "Start with the challenge/outcome… learning to share who you are as well and not be another bot in the industry of… 'Life.'"
