## Hey I'm RyudSwift 👋

### ♠️[Profile](https://ryudswift.github.io/Profile/)  | 🉐[ LIVE - REVIEW](https://ryudswift.github.io/Profile-Review/)

### About Me:
I'm an automation specialist and business strategist passionate about bridging the gap between technology and real-world outcomes. My focus is on building efficient systems and workflows that solve actual problems, not just for the sake of automation itself.

## 🎯 What I'm Focused On

    🤖 Workflow Automation & Orchestration: Deep expertise in designing and implementing automation solutions, especially with tools like n8n.

    📈 SaaS Development & Business Strategy: Advising on lean GTM approaches and helping businesses identify and solve real customer challenges.

    🤝 Community & Education: I believe in learning in public and sharing knowledge. I'm currently building resources to help others get started in automation.

## 🌱 I'm Currently Learning

~~I'm always expanding my toolkit. Right now, my main focus is diving deeper into Python to build more robust and scalable automation engines.
💡 My Philosophy~~


💡 **My Real Philosophy**

Honestly, I'm too impatient to formally "learn" a language from a book. My real passion is hands-on development and systems work. You'll usually find me:

* **Working on a server,** learning development environments and how to set up secure systems. (Though let's be real, vulnerabilities always exist—the goal is to stay vigilant and updated).
* **Building my own projects** or adding features to my personal learning kit just for the fun of it. This might be anything from auto-generating websites to building a proper lead-gen setup that I never fully use because I enjoy the project work more than the marketing.
* **Focusing on security and efficiency.** I've been building custom frontends for my own backends, and I'm loving the challenge of speeding things up by truly *understanding* the frameworks, not just "vibe coding" my way through.

Who knows, maybe the next update to this page will be handled by my AI agents.


I approach problems with a mindset-first perspective. It's not just about the code; it's about asking the right questions.

    "Automation isn’t just about workflows, it’s about solving real business problems."

    "Start with the challenge/outcome… learning to share who you are as well and not be another bot in the industry of… 'Life.'"
